    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
    <p>
      A Muslim, a person, a girl.
      I have recently (2025) graduated in Robotics & Mechatronics Engineering, from the University of Dhaka putting a temporary pause in my life as a student.
      Before I spent 12 years of my study life in Ideal School and College, Motijheel. While I find a proper job in my career to settle down with, I am
      learning things one can do with coding. <br/>
      
      I am, what you call, the classic - "open book extrovert". However, I think I just love to mix with people as each person's unique character and 
      story is forever fascinating to me. Might sound cliche, but my religion, family, friends and country take the top positions in my priority list. I love 
      to explore, the flavours of the world, in any forms it comes - science, arts, literature, theatre, travelling - you name it. <br/> <br/>

    <h2>What I Do</h2>
    <p>
    Before graduation, I started my (pair) research project. This is about collecting MMG (mechanomyographic) signal from arm muscle and mapping
    them according the to muscle compartments. In easier words, trying to figure out how our arm muscle behaves while making movements based on the 
    mechanic signals they are generating. </p> <br/>
    Currently diving deep into web development - front and back along with text-based AI. I am intrigued by projects that are more aligned with real day-to-day life and 
    building tools that make ideas easier to share and understand.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Tech I am working with:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li> Django </li>
        <li> React </li>
        <li> Node.JS </li>
        <li> my SQL </li>
        <li> LLM </li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    I take pride in my teaching ability. Besides two years of classroom experience, I have taught neumerous students - mathematics, the apparent "terror"
    for high school students. I still have this going and love every moment of it.

    <h2>Beyond Skills</h2>
    <p>
        I am a lifelong snoop, dabbling into hundreds of hobbies but rarely sticking to any. <br/> <br/>
        But my long-term accompany has always been my books and writings. A good story of any kind, and I can abandon the world for a while.
        I can laugh, cry and rage with the characters. And then I find liberation in writing little bit of all the threads that go looping around in my head.
        I stitch, bake, do poetries, paint murals (as long as there‚Äôs a wall), craft ambigrams, and explore languages like Arabic, Japanese, and Chinese.
        I‚Äôve tried my hand at 3D modeling ‚Äî both organic and CAD ‚Äî along with digital illustration <br/><br/>
        Topics on Islam, comparative religion, geopolitics, economics, psychology, and history keep me endlessly fascinated. I go after new 
        cuisines, love quiet caf√©s, and spend late nights diving into philosophy videos. If it‚Äôs new, I want to know it.
